## Features:
1. Set your own schedule for specific habits
   1. Eg. workout Monday, Tuesday, Thursday
2. Daily checkin
3. Write notes/description of habits
4. Keep track of streaks
   1. streaks are calculated according to schedule for a particular habit

## To Do:
\#4: Calculate streaks based on habit schedule
Figure out router stuff ==> refetch data when navigating from Create habit to Home page.
I think router.push() does it?

__ISSUE__:
If the checkin button is clicked multiple times very quickly, the browser doesnt have enough time to check that the user already signed in
